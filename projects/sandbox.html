  <p>Sandbox was a six-month project long headed between a friend and myself. Our team consisted of four other UC Berkeley CS students, and we frequently sought consultation with Berkeley High Students.
  <p>Our aim was to create a high school program where we practiced human-centered design concepts to increase the creative confidence of students. We decided to focus creating websites and having a curriculum that featured design and CS.</p>
