<div class="description">
  <p>Lucky Cricket is a small startup that sells cricket flour. They wanted a small website test customer interest.</p>
  <p>I built the site from a HTML/CSS/Bootstraps mockup. I added a Rails back-end to save customer data and modified the CSS and Javascript to fit the client's specifications.</p>
