  <p>I was the VP of Engineering at SupperShare, an early stage startup dedicated to enabling people to share their home cooked meals. The platform is a ruby on rails app that uses bootstraps</p> 
  <p>When creating new features, I made sure that the features were implemented securely by running comprehensive tests. When designing the features, I made the features easy to use as a user, and I integrated the features to matched the UI and UX of the current platform.</p>
