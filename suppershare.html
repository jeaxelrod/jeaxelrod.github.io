  <p>I was the VP of Engineering at SupperShare, which was at the time a team of four for which I was the only technical personnel. Thus ,I played an important role in acting as the liaison between the business and technical decisions and the users and platform.</p>
  <p>When creating new features I made sure that the features were implemented securely by running comprehensive tests and integrated it into the UI so that it matched the current workflow in the platform and worked intuitively with the user.</p>
