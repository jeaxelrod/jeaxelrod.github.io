  <p>Sandbox was a six-month project long headed between Jeff Negata and Myself. Our aim was to create a high school program where we introduce human-centered design to increase the creative confidence of students. We decided to focus on front-end web development. It was a good intersection between the combining the interests of the students and our goal to teach design thinking. I ended the project because I lacked time and wanted to focus on my own web development. </p>
